On startup tomorrow: Making student page look better with Card.Header utilized


9/6/2022
Clean up backend code and models


**Something that seriously needs doing**
Refactor components/StudentAttendance


Registration Object in backend could be changed to just return the conflicts or  null

StudentPage session registrations need to be refactored to display the same as InstructorPage sessions

Why is a StudentRegistration class inside of SimpleSessionView.cs?
