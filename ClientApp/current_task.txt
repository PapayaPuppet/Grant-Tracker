Registration Object in backend could be changed to just return the conflicts or  null

StudentPage session registrations need to be refactored to display the same as InstructorPage sessions

Why is a StudentRegistration class inside of SimpleSessionView.cs?

I honestly thing returning Views from repositories is a mistake. We should convert them to a view IN the controllers. Definitely the best way to go

Editor->involved instructor fetching needs to be passed user current organization to properly display the selected instructors. Low priority as this only effects admin
